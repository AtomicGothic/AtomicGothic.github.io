    Evidently, one can do animations with CSS3 rather than use JavaScript.<br>
    Use the "transform" property in CSS3 to change the orientation or to skew the position of a given html element<br>
    The general rule to follow to see if something can be transitioned is seeing if in between the beginning and end states<br>
    there is an in between state that can be reached.<br>
    Using CSS3 animations seems to be an archaic method from the 90s. Possibly it could still be used in moderation<br>
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -Surely, there must be some kind of code going on under the hood of CSS3 to make the animations happen. Is it just JavaScript cleverly hidden?<br>
    -Why does Canvas not follow the Cartesian grid method?<br>
