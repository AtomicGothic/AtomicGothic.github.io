    The 'this' keyword did take some getting used to for me when I first encountered it in my C++ classes. It's very handy once you understand<br>
    what it is. In short, 'this' just refers to the current iteration of a given object.<br><br>
    Declaring objects and accessing the methods and member variables within these objects seems to be similar to C++, although apparently one can<br>
    access member variables with brackets and single quotes. That one can't do in C++.<br>
    To add a new property into an object, you can use the '.' operator followed by the name of the new property and then set that to whatever value<br>
    desired. Use the delete operator to delete a given property from the object. Objects can also be nested within objects.<br><br>
    Note: Objects are copied by reference. The copied object merely points to the original. Changes to either reference will change the other.<br><br>
    To prevent naming collisions, consider using namespaces for potentially repeated generic names of functions or properties.<br><br>
    JSON is a very powerful and incredibly useful tool for building APIs. I've used JSON when getting data from an API call. I know C# has functions<br>
    that will parse the data as needed and desired.<br><br>
    Beware of rounding errors with floating numbers. Computers use base 2 math, which is binary. Consequently, it is difficult to have accurate floating<br>
    numbers when working with base 2 math. Just make sure your code has some tolerance and doesn't require a high degree of accuracy for floating numbers.<br><br>
    Don't use the getYear() method, since it is not Y2K compliant.<br><br>
    I just learned about RegExp in my database class. I imagine JavaScript and MySQL can work nicely together when using RegExp to call and make queries.<br><br>
    DOM is a wonderful tool to allow modifications to the various parts of an HTML page.<br><br>
    Each element should have a unique ID. Having the same ID for multiple HTML elements will cause odd behavior.<br><br>
    Use 'classList' to modify a particular element's class rather than using 'className'. Using the latter will modify all other classes that have<br><br>
    already been set on the element.<br><br>
    DOM has event listeners that allow you to link JavaScript code to a particular action. For example, if you click on a picture, you can have<br>
    some function run to make the picture do something.<br>
    Don't use 'click' and 'doubleclick' on the same element. It will likely cause some unexpected behavior because the two listeners may overlap each other.<br><br>
    Don't use anonymous functions as arguments for adding event listeners if you want to eventually remove that listener.<br><br>
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -Are there alternative equivalent technologies to JSON?<br>
    -Why is JavaScript inconsistent with requiring the 'new' keyword when creating a new object? Sometimes you can use '{}' and sometimes you can't.
    -Why not make the getYear() function Y2K compliant?
    -Why use touch events at all? It seems better to stick with the click events.
