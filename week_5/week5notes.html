    Do your best to program for the benefit of the user. Most users don't have the mind of developers. Even so, programming for users means<br>
    making the software experience easy and intuitive for the human mind.<br><br>
    Exceptions are errors that produce a return value.<br><br>
    Follow the call stack to find out where the error happened<br><br>
    Warnings don't mean that the program will stop running, but it may cause issues down the line if not addressed<br><br>
    JavaScript is a language that is pretty forgiving and likes to fail silently in the background. This is not always helpful<br>
    To counter this, make sure that your errors will fail to grab your attention. Also use strict mode so that way your JavaScript code will<br>
    catch more issues and let you know.<br><br>
    Use alerts and breakpoints to help decode your code. They will interrupt your code at certain points so you can go through the executing<br>
    code step by step.<br><br>
    You can throw your own exceptions to make the errors be more readable. Consider using try/catches.<br><br>
    Consider using testing frameworks to help you debug and test your functions<br><br>
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -Where is the line drawn between user and programmer errors? In other words, at what point does user error become the fault of the user?<br>
