    Forms are probably the most common way we interact with websites. Websites typically exist to gather information from and give<br>
    information to the user. Forms are a way to gather information from the user. One must remember though that all software and websites<br>
    exist for the user. Therefore, the interface must be designed for humans. Refer back to CSE 471 for user interface concepts.<br><br>
    Forms are stored in an array in the order they appear on the webpage.<br><br>
    Don't use the reset button to clear out the whole form unless you have a really good reason for it. It's typically considered bad practice.<br><br>
    Alerts are not considered good practice to give user feedback<br><br>
    Normally, submitting a form with the "submit" keyword will send the form data to the back-end to be processed. To interrupt this process,<br>
    use preventDefault().<br><br>
    Be sure to indicate what type of input the input element is.<br><br>
    Input types can be checkboxes. Note that you can iterate through the array of forms that are checkboxes to see how many are checked. Useful for<br>
    large selection options.<br><br>
    Radio types are like checkboxes but only one option can be selected<br><br>
    There are many input types. Different input types are useful for gathering different kinds of information. Think of it as setting data types<br>
    when declaring variables in C++. You want to make sure that you are getting the right kind of data in the right place.<br><br>
    Make sure you validate the data in the forms you create. Validation should occur both on the front end and on the back end. For security reasons,<br>
    the back end validation should be the one to rely on because the front end JavaScript validation can be bypassed by savvy users, but JavaScript<br>
    validation should still be used to create a better user experience.<br><br>
    I didn't realize that JavaScript could be written in object oriented fashion. Also, it is fortunate that ES6 offers class declaration similar<br>
    to other languages like Java and C++, since that is what I'm more familiar with.<br><br>
    Remember, the whole point of OOP is to have code be modular and reusable. Don't have your classes, methods, and functions do more than what they<br>
    ought to do. If you need to code new functionality, put it in a different method or maybe a whole new class. Additionally, try to keep coupling minimal<br>
    Code that has high coupling runs the risk of spaghettification.<br><br>
    Making class variables private is not done the same way as in C++. Variables can be made private only be limiting scope of the variable. In other words<br>
    declare the variable inside the constructor.<br><br>
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -What is the difference between text, textarea, and blockquote elements?
    -Why is monkey-patching frowned upon in the JavaScript community? Is the consensus warranted?
