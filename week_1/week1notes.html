   Building for mobile first allows you to build for the all settings. Building down from a desktop setting makes it harder to make that website <br>
   mobile friendly. However building mobile friendly first and then scaling up to a desktop experience may be a challenge but it is overall better<br>
   practice. More people are interesting in buying small devices rather than buying large computers like desktops or laptops. <br>
   Mobile users have a very short attention span. Therefore, make your steps to do a task short. <br><br>
   Consider usability for mobile users. Remember that people use their thumbs often for using their devices. Don't have your elements on your website<br>
   be far to reach for thumbs. Make sure your websites load as quickly as possible. Not everyone has the best internet connections. Don't have bulky<br>
   images or bloat code.<br><br>
   Remember, you're building apps and websites for users, not computers. In other words, don't make it harder for users to your app. Make sure that<br>
   users don't care if your app has the best memory usage efficiency if they can't easily use the app. Also, users are people, and people use visual<br>
   cues, so using intuitive symbols for navigation is important.<br><br>
   To reduce the number of input fields on forms, don't request unnecessary information. Also, filling forms from a mobile device is error prone, so<br>
   make it easier by allowing autofill. Present the best keyboard necessary for inputting the right information.<br><br>
   Advertisements need to be properly shown for mobile environments. Don't use pop ups, and don't use ads that work for desktops.
   <br><br>
   Questions: How can I make this task easier? Is there such a thing as too few steps?
