    Notate your code. It helps you and your colleagues understand what is going on in the code.<br><br>
    Interestingly, JavaScript doesn't require a semicolon at the end of each statement. JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic<br>
    Semicolon Insertion to place semicolons where it thinks a semicolon is needed. However, it is best practice to end all of your JavaScript statements<br>
    with a semicolon. This comes naturally for me since my fist programming language is C++. Note that blocks do not need to end with a semicolon.<br><br>
    The following are reserved words in the JavScript language:<br>
    abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger,<br>
    default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function,<br>
    goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private,<br>
    protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true,<br>
    try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield<br><br>
    These words should have been reserved by the language but aren't: undefined, NaN, Infinity.<br><br>
    let and const have block scope, whereas var does not. Keep that in mind.<br><br>
    Interestingly, template literals were introduced to JavaScript. It allows interpolation of JavaScript code. This is similarly done in C#.<br>
