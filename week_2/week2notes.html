    Notate your code. It helps you and your colleagues understand what is going on in the code.<br><br>
    Interestingly, JavaScript doesn't require a semicolon at the end of each statement. JavaScript interpreters use a process called Automatic<br>
    Semicolon Insertion to place semicolons where it thinks a semicolon is needed. However, it is best practice to end all of your JavaScript statements<br>
    with a semicolon. This comes naturally for me since my fist programming language is C++. Note that blocks do not need to end with a semicolon.<br><br>
    The following are reserved words in the JavScript language:<br>
    abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch, char, class, const, continue, debugger,<br>
    default, delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends, false, final, finally, float, for, function,<br>
    goto, if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface, let, long, native, new, null, package, private,<br>
    protected, public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized, this, throw, throws, transient, true,<br>
    try, typeof, var, volatile, void, while, with, yield<br><br>
    These words should have been reserved by the language but aren't: undefined, NaN, Infinity.<br><br>
    let and const have block scope, whereas var does not. Keep that in mind.<br><br>
    Interestingly, template literals were introduced to JavaScript. It allows interpolation of JavaScript code. This is similarly done in C#.<br><br>
    Arrays in JavaScript do not have to contain the same type of data. It can contain a mixture of different data types.<br>
    "Popping" data off an array does not reduce the size of the array. The empty slots in the array are left as undefined. To remove the slot<br>
    completely, you'll need to reduce the size of the array. Alternatively, you can use splice().<br><br>
    Sets seem to be like arrays but not as strict. It is possible to have memory leaks while using sets, so be wary.<br><br>
    Creating maps in JavaScript require the 'new' operator.<br><br>
    The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing and 'if/else' statement.<br>
    JavaScript switch statements are similarly written to C++ switch statements.<br>
    Loops in JavaScript have a similar syntax to those in C++. JavaScript does have a 'for of' loop that warrants investigation.<br><br>
    Declaring functions in JavaScript is similar to C++ but you don't have to specify the return type of the function.<br>
    Functions can be declared using an "arrow", which looks like this '=>'. It is useful for short, anonymous functions.<br>
    Consider using these arrow anonymous functions for callbacks in functions.
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -What really is the difference between a set and an array? They seem to be very similar.<br>
    -Why don't normal sets have garbage-collection?<br>
    -How does the 'for of' loop work? Is it better to use than conventional 'for' loops?<br>
