    IIFE stands for "Immediately Invoked Function Expressions." they are anonymous functions that are invoked as soon as they're defined.<br>
    Using callback functions is necessary for writing asynchronous functions. This is important if you want to call an API and not have your<br>
    user think that your program crashed.<br>
    When doing functional programming, make sure that you are not modifying the passed in values. You can return new data, but not at the cost of<br>
    modifying incoming data.<br>
    AJAX was invented to allow websites to dynamically get information from the server, which allows the web-app to have more features and performances<br>
    The jQuery library is an option rather than using the "wild frontier" of the Fetch API standard.<br>
    <br><br>Questions:<br>
    -Would one want to use temporary variables for security purposes?<br>
    -Are the call and apply functions somehow innate within any function? The textbook did not seem to declare such functions in the examples.<br>
    -Beyond JSON and XML, are there other data formats that are used via APIs?<br>
    -Why not just use jQuery rather than use the rough AJAX methods?<br>
